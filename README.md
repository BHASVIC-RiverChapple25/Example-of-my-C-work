# C-Chapter6-2DArrays
This chapter covers two-dimensional (2D) arrays.

The arrays in the previous chapter were _technically_ one-dimensional arrays because each item in the array was a single value. 

A 2D array is an "array of arrays" e.g. [[a,b,c],[a,b,c],[a,b,c],[a,b,c],[a,b,c],[a,b,c]]

The easiest way to visualise this is as a table where each row has multiple columns (or vice-versa). It's important to remember though that they aren't actually tables so there are multiple ways to visualise the same 2D array.

Index|0|1|2|
---|---|---|---|
0|a|b|c
1|a|b|c
2|a|b|c
3|a|b|c
4|a|b|c
5|a|b|c

Index|0|1|2|3|4|5
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
0|a|a|a|a|a|a|
1|b|b|b|b|b|b|
2|c|c|c|c|c|c|

If each item in each inner array is also an array (an "array of arrays of arrays") then this is a 3D array (and so on) but these are harder to visualise.

## C-Chapter Structure
While you are learning C you will be working through a series of structured activites following a structure called **PRIMM**. This process is designed to slowly introduce new concepts, allowing you to build confidence, rather than throwing you in at the deep end.

In this repository you will find ten files:
+ Student Work - Chapter 4a - While.pptx **(Start Here)**
+ Student Work - Chapter 4b - DoWhile.pptx **(Then this one...)**
+ Student Work - Chapter 4c - For.pptx **(Then this one...)**
+ Supporting Documentation - Chapter 4ab - While.pptx **(Read this fully)**
+ Supporting Documentation - Chapter 4c - For.pptx **(Read this fully)**
+ Starter Code - Chapter 4a.c **(This is the code for the 4a slides)**
+ Starter Code - Chapter 4b.c **(This is the code for the 4b slides)**
+ Starter Code - Chapter 4c.c **(This is the code for the 4c slides)**
+ README.md (You are reading this!)
+ .gitignore (Ignore this)

## PRIMM Programming Explained

You will move through a series of stages that mean the code you are running goes: 

Not yours --> Partly yours --> All yours.

The stages are:

### Predict
In this stage you are given a piece of code and need you try to figure out what the code would do when it is run.

### Run
In this stage you download and run the code to see if your prediction was correct. The reasons we are giving you the code are:

+ It *should* mean that your code definitely runs.
+ There is less chance (in theory no chance) that an error will slip in.
+ It's quicker!!

### Investigate
In this stage you are figuring out how the code works:

+ What does each line do?
+ What variables are being used?
+ What data types are being processed?

### Modify
In this stage you start to make changes to exisiting code, changing outputs, changing process, etc.

You are still working with the code that you were given so the chances of errors are still fairly low but as you make changes you might accidentally remove a semi-colon so having the other lines of code already should help you figure the mistake out.

### Make
In this stage you are **finally** writing your own code! 

By starting a completely fresh program you now have full ownership of the code but you'll have already seen the concept, investigated the concept and even modified code containing the concept before reaching this stage.

# FAQs

## Do we have to learn C?
Yes

## Why?
Because C teaches you important concepts that other languages simplfy - making you a better programmer.

## Do we have to follow PRIMM?
Yes

## Why?
Because research has shown that it following the steps has a positive outcome on learning the programming concepts that you need to understand.

## Why do we need to Predict what the code does?
Because being able to look at a piece of code and understand what it does is an important skill. You should also be able to figure out what the output, given a specific input will be.
